<!-- PDF Converter -->

This is a local application that does what is says on the tin. 
I made this convert files on my own computer so i didn't need to pay for a subscription to adobe or use an online converter that might save my sensitive details. 

I used Env variable in my application for an extra layer of security.

you can use this app without creating an environment variable, just follow steps 1. 

# step 1)
- create a directory called 'image_files'
- create a directory called 'converted_to_PDF'
both in the root directory

# step 2) 
- set up a local environment variable. i used dotenv
- list your .env in your .gitignore file
